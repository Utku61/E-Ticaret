2016-04-11 20:37:23,210 WARN com.mchange.v2.c3p0.management.ActiveManagementCoordinator:68 [ContainerBackgroundProcessor[StandardEngine[Catalina]]] A C3P0Registry mbean is already registered. This probably means that an application using c3p0 was undeployed, but not all PooledDataSources were closed prior to undeployment. This may lead to resource leaks over time. Please take care to close all PooledDataSources.
